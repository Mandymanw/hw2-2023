        <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 ripe avocados</li>
            <li>1 small red onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>2 ripe tomatoes, diced</li>
            <li>1-2 jalapeño peppers, seeded and finely chopped (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>Juice of 2 limes</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Avocados: Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh into a mixing bowl. Use a fork to mash the avocados to your desired level of smoothness. Some prefer it chunky, while others like it creamy.</li>
            <li>Add the Lime Juice: Squeeze the juice of two limes over the mashed avocados. The lime not only adds a zesty flavor but also helps prevent the guacamole from browning.</li>
            <li>Combine the Ingredients: Add the diced red onion, tomatoes, jalapeño peppers, minced garlic, and chopped cilantro to the mashed avocados. These ingredients provide a balance of textures and flavors.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl combine the flour, baking soda, cocoa powder and salt</li>
            <li>Season to Taste: Season the guacamole with salt and pepper, adjusting the amounts to suit your preferences. Keep in mind that you can always add more, so start with a little and taste as you go.</li>
            <li>Mix Thoroughly: Gently fold all the ingredients together until they are well combined. Be careful not to overmix, as you want to maintain some texture in the guacamole.</li> 
            <li>Taste and Adjust: Give the guacamole a taste test. If you feel it needs more acidity, you can add extra lime juice. If it's not spicy enough, you can add more jalapeño or a pinch of cayenne pepper.</li>
        </ol>

            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the Bacon: In a skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon slices until they are crispy and golden brown. Place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess grease.</li>
            <li>Prep the Avocado: While the bacon is cooking, cut the ripe avocado in half, remove the pit, and slice the flesh into thin, even pieces.</li> 
            <li>FPrepare the Bread: Toast the four slices of bread to your desired level of crispiness. You can do this in a toaster or a separate skillet with a touch of butter for extra flavor.</li>
            <li>Assemble the Sandwich.</li>
            <li>Slice and Serve: Carefully cut the sandwich in half diagonally, creating two triangular halves. Secure each half with a toothpick or wrap in parchment paper for easy handling. Serve your Blat sandwich immediately, and enjoy this delicious fusion of flavors and textures!</li>
